Main File: company.py

This file defines classes "Customer" and "Employee". The base class
"Person" is imported from person.py, and is inherited by the classes.
Unique instance variables are created for each class with accessor and
mutator methods. The __str__() method is then overrided so it will format
and return the information. The classes can now be imported by
test_company.py to display profile information for customers and employees
of a company.
